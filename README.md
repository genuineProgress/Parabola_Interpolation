College project as part of Numerical methods course.
Designed to count and show the order of parabola approximation using piecewise linear functions. 
Python program counts respect coefficients of piecewise linear functions and then plots several graphs 
of initial parabola and resulting approximating functions with defined number of units. 
Tex report (in Russian) contains related description of coefficient's computing and program's outcome.
